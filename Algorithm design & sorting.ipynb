    "The iterative approach uses a for-loop to compute the Fibonacci sequence by summing the two numbers assigned in temporary values and updating thier values. This solution is very efficient as the time complexity is linear, $O(n)$, because of $T(n) = n$ (loop), and requires very little space ($O(1)$-constant) because as N changes, space/memory used remains the same, i.e. the amount of space needed for $fib(0)$ and $fib(100)$ is same.\n",

    "The recursive approach when $n>1$ calls on itself several times to compute the sum of first and second number until it is downsized to the base case (n is less than or equal to 1). The time complexity in this case is exponential, $O(2^n)$, as for $n > 1$ the function calls itself twice: $T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + c$. For upper bound, we can assume that $T(n-2) ~ T(n-1)$ and after calculation we would get $T(n) = 2^n * (1 + c) - c$. Thus, $O(2^n)$. The space required in this approach is proportional to the maximum depth of the recursion tree because to compute each nth term it has to compute each previous term."

Then, the function checks if the new (swapped) element at the right position. While it is not at the right position, the function repeats previous steps to swap this elements to its right position.

    "Docstring is used to give a general overview of what to expect from the given piece of the code. It starts and ends with ''' and can be divided into multiple sections to explain what parameters are in the code, what it does, what are the inputs/output/expected results, etc. This kind of comments is written mostly for people who are going to be using the given code without needing or wanting to know how it works (its logic). For example, in this class, we receive our pre-class work with pieces of code, which include docstring to set expectations of what the code should do without telling how it will work (so, we know the expectations and based on that write the logic of the code). At the workplace, this is very useful as, most of the time, you would need to use various pieces of code written by other developers inside your code. However, you won't need to know how it works line-by-line, but instead what it does in general and how to use it correctly in your code. So, docstring can be treated as a smaller version of documentation (guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the in-line comments are used to explain what the code does inside (the logic, can go as far as explaining every line). The in-line comments, in general, are right after the line of code it is supposed to present, followed by #. This is in general used to explain what is going on to people who want to extend the code/rewrite the code. For example, after a few years of code being written, you need to update it based on a new release of Python. For that, you would need to understand what the code does the logic behind every line to be able to update it to work correctly with the new version of Python. In this class, the students use in-line code to explain what exactly their code does to the reviewers to show the understanding of the code's logic. Thus, the in-line code is used to describe the code itself rather than usage. However, it doesn't mean that every line of the code should have an in-line comment. Those comments should be informative for non-obvious parts of the code and for essential (even if obvious) parts of the code. "

    "While thinking about time complexity of 3-way merge sort, we assume we are sorting s total of n elements in the entire list. Looking at the code, we have two divide steps, which take constant time regardless of the subarray size. So, we have here constant time in big-O notation : $O(1)$. Then, we have a conquer part: recursively sorting 3 subarrays of approx. $n/3$ elements each which take $T(n/3)$ time each. Finally, we have a combine steps, which merges a total of n events and takes linear amount of time: $O(n)$. Thus, time complexity of 3-way merge is $O(nlog_3n)$. The extended calculations and tree digram below show how we get to this answer. We also see from the code that the space complexity of this merge sort is $O(3n)$ or just $O(n)$ as it creates three temporary placeholders for subarrays and feeds in the sorted elements back to the actual array."

    "The 3-way merge sort with threshold includes also a bubble sort. As we saw from graphical comparision of time complexity of 3-way merge sort and bubble sort, bubble sort is more efficient for small number of elements in the array ($n<20$). The time complexity of bubble sort is $O(n^2)$. Space complexity in bubble sort is $O(1)$ as it it requires just one additional place for the temporary value. Now, to find time complexity of this enhanced merge sort, we need to combine the complexity of 3-way merge sort and bubble sort. As we saw from analysis of 3-way merge sort, its time complexity will be $𝑂(𝑛log(n/x))$ where $log(n/x)$ is the number of sublists. Here, we are sorting $n/x$ lists each of 𝑥 elements using bubble sort. So, time complexity of bubble sort would be either in best case $(n/x) * x$  or in worst $(n/x) * x^2$, where $x^2$ and $x$ are regular worst/best time complexities of bubble sort ($O(n^2)$ or $O(n)$). Thus, the total time complexity of 3-way merge sort with threshold would be in best case $O(𝑛+𝑛log_3(n/3))$ and in worst case $O(3n+𝑛log_3(n/3))$. This time complexity simplifies to $O(𝑛log_3(n/3))$ which is $<$ time complexity of regular 3-way merge, $O(nlog_3n)$."

    "From the graphical representation of the time complexity comparision of two sorting algorithms, we also see that 3-way merge sort with threshold outperforms regular 3-way merge. Also, as the enhanced 3-way merge doesn't require bigger space complexity (as bubble sort has O(1) space coomplexity), this approach seems even more efficient to use as with smaller lists (less than 20 elements), the space complexity will also outperform the rugular 3-way merge."
